# Mission
My mission is to help a community of learners master technical skills through real-world projects and clear, hands-on teaching ‚Äî empowering them to understand how analytics works, tackle complex projects with confidence, and present their work like professionals, no matter their starting point.

# About Me :books:
I‚Äôm a Data Analyst with a passion for solving real business problems using data. Over the past few years, I‚Äôve worked with startups, SMEs, and personal projects to turn messy data into clear insights ‚Äî the kind that help teams make smarter decisions.

My strengths lie in:
SQL, Power BI, Excel, and Python for deep analysis and dashboard storytelling
Breaking down complex datasets to uncover patterns, track performance, and drive improvement
Teaching and mentoring ‚Äî I‚Äôve helped over 100 people upskill in SQL and data storytelling through workshops and 1-on-1 mentoring

What sets me apart is how I blend technical skill with business thinking. 
I don‚Äôt just pull numbers, I ask the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind the data, communicate insights clearly, and tie them back to business goals. 
I also believe in documentation, clean processes, and making sure data work is reproducible and scalable.

Right now, I‚Äôm focused on growing my impact in the data space which means taking on more collaborative projects, mentoring analysts, and exploring how data drives growth in different sectors
